placeholder for boards

List boards
+ new board
view boards on list
for a board, render the current tickets on due date and order
render list of available tickets

thoughts: we need to have a list of draggable tickets to place onto the board. tickets should be dragable on the board and between the holding pen and the board.
We also need to render the available status columns, with a way to toggle them on/off.

So we are going for a simply icebox and progression view. NOT dates. We might want relative order.


adding/editing a  board should be a modal overlay
