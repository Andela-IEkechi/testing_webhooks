Comments controller + specs

Attachments on comments: 
  need to allow multiple attachments per comment.
  needs to be stored in-app, NOT on s3/disc... the attachments need to reside in the DB (see gem refile-postgres)

Limit users based on accounts:
  limit as per current conductor ?
    small: 1gb storage, 5 colaborators, 1 project
    medium: 5gb storage, 25 colaborators, 5 projects
    large: 25gb storage, 125 colaborators, 25 projects 

API keys for hooking in to GH etc.
  need to process commmit hooks, CI builds
  might also want to look at exposing API endpoints for alowing others to integrate with us (LOW PRIORITY)

Social signon: 
  Facebook,
  Twitter, 
  Github,
  Google,
  other?

Ticket tracking (Andre's idea)
  allow only one ticket open per user. opening another will close the previous.
  track open/close times for time log report
  auto-close tickets at end of business (membership config)
  we will need to set a "current active user" value on the ticket. Combined with the updated_at timestamp this might give us all we need.

tickets statuses:
  add sytem status: new, open, on hold, invalid, closed
  custom states per project
  state ordering per project
  state colours per project

Ticket tags

Ticket splitting

WYSIWYG editing on comments

Incoming email channel
  emails should open faux tickets which can be moderated, turned into tickets.
  automatic response on emails that make it to tickets. (canned, not custom yet)

Boards
  replaces sprints/features
  has due date
  daily status email

Reports
  time log report
    per project, per member(s)


Low Priority
------------

Soft-delete on all models (via application_record)
  Gem "paranoia" does this, but is not geared up for active record 5 yet.
  I think this feature can wait untill it's needed. It's easy enough to add later and a pain in the ass once it's added.
