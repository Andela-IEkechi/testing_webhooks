581	40	5	8	\N	13	The requirements seem to want to keep the refinancing information separate from liabilities. It seems this is just to check that the refinance amount being requested covers the existing loans.\r\n\r\nWe have a few options to tackle this:\r\n\r\n1. Leave the liabilities section as it is and add a checkbox so that the applicant can indicate which liabilities are the ones that are being refinanced. The checked items will then be ignored on the backend when running the serviceability calculations, but will be taken in to account when doing the check that the finance amount covers/matches the total loan amounts. This would probably require at least 1 - 1.5 days of work.\r\n\r\n2. Use the liabilities section as is, but for FairGo add a check to ignore any "Personal loan" type liabilities from the serviceability calculations. This is probably the quicker method, but requires the user to specify the loans they're consolidating very specifically. Probably in the order of 1 day of work.\r\n\r\n3. Create a new section separate from the current Liabilities section to capture the loans the user is applying to consolidate. This has the advantage of keeping the required data separate from the liabilities, so we wouldn't have to fiddle with any other calculations. We can record the data in the meta field of the application or in a new table entirely, which might be cleaner. Rough estimate on this would be in the region of 2 days work, depending on how we store the data.	2	3	2012-11-13 12:12:45.530864	2012-11-13 12:12:45.530864	<p>The requirements seem to want to keep the refinancing information separate from liabilities.

However, please only do this if we know that it will not cause page upload delays.  Perhaps this can happen as part of our move to Amazon hosting?

The Glass Guide database we get sent contains information for both new and used vehicles, and we store the new/used information in the same vehicle record.\r\n\r\nWe store the Glass Guide database across the following tables:\r\n\r\n* glass\\_kilometres \r\n* glass\\_kilometres\\_vehicles \r\n* glass\\_option\\_values \r\n* glass\\_options \r\n* glass\\_option_details \r\n* glass\\_vehicles\r\n\r\nWe store the selected vehicle details in the following tables:\r\n\r\n* glasses\\_selected\\_vehicles \r\n* glasses\\_selected\\_factory\\_options\r\n\r\nA vehicle in the glass\\_vehicles table always contains used vehicle information (i.e. price\\_p, price\\_pp and price\\_ppp).

2794	863	\N	28	\N	7	Hi Support,\r\n \r\nI think we need to treat this bug as a priority, perhaps for Friday or Monday.  It’s a long running bug that has been outstanding for too long, but we’ve had two support issues on this bug in two days.\r\n \r\nThe Problem:  For a boat application, if the applicant’s living arrangement is “mortgaged”, it keeps asking for 37 months of living history, regardless of how long it’s been supplied, and therefore it won’t submit the application.  The only way around this is to change it to “fully owned”, submit, then go in  and change it again.  An example is ID: 37515.\r\n \r\nSolution:  Please fix to allow a “mortgaged” residential status.  Please note this is one of our old application wizards-  would it be easier to convert to a new one, or simply fix the immediate issue?\r\n\r\n![image006.jpg](https://conductorappsa.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/comment/asset/payload/275/image006.jpg)	1	10	2013-01-31 09:55:01.631196	2013-01-31 09:55:32.449639	<p>Hi Support,</p>\n\n<p>I think we need to treat this bug as a priority, perhaps for Friday or Monday.

When an application is submitted (E.G. #37608) it is telling the applicant/broker that ‘Something hasn’t gone to plan, we will look into it shortly’???  The application is then coming into our ‘incomplete ‘ section. We are then re-submitting the application and it works fine? But the clients are being instantly “thrown off” with an inconsistent decision?\r\n \r\nDeals that went to incomplete over the weekend:\r\n37608AUST\r\n37607AUST\r\n37606AUST\r\n \r\nPlease also have a look at deal for 37607AUST.   The applicant has been at current address since January 2011 and it still asked for a previous address – client put the same details in previous address.  The deal was then referred due to the following:\r\n\r\n![image001.png](https://conductorappsa.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/comment/asset/payload/304/image001.png)\r\n\r\nPlease look into this ASAP as we have already lost 1 deal over the weekend that should have come through as conditionally approved upon submitting. (37608AUST)\r\n \r\nAlso could you please update the reference section to only have 2 required references.  The other 3 are causing us & the applicants problems submitting the deal.\r\n \r\nWe also\r\n \r\n \r\nThanks	1	10	2013-02-04 00:23:10.774535	2013-02-04 00:24:12.995777	<p>Hi Kosta,</p>\n\n<p>We have had a problem with Easylodge application since Friday morning.

5521	1321	13	28	10	7	We have identified that the offer system has a calculation error somewhere that is being applied consistently and giving inappropriate offer. Pls refer to #39710AUST as an example.\r\n\r\nThe original loan amount sought is for $6500.00. Offer system calculated a re-offer up to $9326.00.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that on acceptance off the offer - Income for the client is $2693.83 and Expenses are $2804.91 & therefore Not Eligible for an Approval?\r\n\r\nWe manually serviced the client against the information on the application and the client could only service an amount less than $6000.00 from the outset!\r\n\r\nOn initial audit of the issue, we are of the opinion that the offer system is miscalculating the Income V’s Liabilities???\r\n\r\nWe think, the offer system is not encapsulating the liabilities noted on the application ( rent, credit cards, loans etcc) and basing the Offer solely on Income/APF Repayment amount.\r\n\r\nThis is occurring frequently (including up scaling our 100% centrelink income applicants passed the $8000.00 lending max limit credit rule) E.G. - #39709AUST\r\n\r\nCan I suggest removing the offer system until you can diagnose the problem and test it again pls.
